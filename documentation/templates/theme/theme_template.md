"As a DevOps student, I want to create a website that educates teachers of new technology to improve instruction. By creating this website, we can keep teachers informed and current with technologies that are used within industry. This will enable us to raise the level of education the educator can provide, and meet our customers needs. By following continuous development principals, we can quickly and effectively create an educational website, setting us up for teachers with the most current knowledge of software development technologies."
